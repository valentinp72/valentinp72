This summer, I did my second Interrail trip. With an [Interrail](https://www.interrail.eu/en) pass, you can travel with many different trains throughout Europe with little to no additional cost. In this post, I will share some pictures I made during this trip through 5 different countries, as well as share the route and trains I have taken.
<!-- My previous Interrail trip was described in [this post](/posts/interrail-2021). -->

My journey (5,652 km) started and ended in Le Mans, France. I spent 2 days, 5 hours and 33 minutes inside trains, out of 12 days of travel.

## A] :denmark: Copenhagen

My first destination was Copenhagen in Denmark. To get there, I took a TGV (French high speed train) from Le Mans at 9:30 to Strasbourg (France), followed by another TGV to Karlsruhe (Germany) and then an ICE (German high speed train) to Hamburg (Germany). I arrived there at 21:29 with enough time to get a nice lunch before taking the [Snalltaget](https://www.snalltaget.se/en), a night train service that took me to Ørestad (near Copenhagen), Denmark.

## B] :sweden: Gothenburg

The next day, I took the [Oresundstag](https://www.oresundstag.se/en) train to Gothenburg in Sweden. This train rides on the magnificient Øresund Bridge linking Denmark and Sweden.

## C] :sweden: Stockholm

Gothenburg to the capital of Sweden, Stockholm, is really easy and fast with the high speed train from [SJ](https://www.sj.se/en/) (about 3h for 450km). In this train, you can enjoy the views of many different lakes passing by, while eating a delicious meal (if you pre-order it when booking).

## D] :de: Berlin

I then took the [EuroNight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EuroNight#List_of_EuroNight_trains) train 345 operated by SJ, from Stockholm Central to Berlin Hauptbahnhof. Leaving Stockholm at 17:34, you arrive in Berlin at 9:00.

## E] :netherlands: Rotterdam and The Hague

After Berlin, I took one of my last train of this trip to get to Rotterdam, Netherlands. The train (IC 148), operated by [DB](https://www.bahn.de/) left Berlin Hauptbahnhof at 8:33 and arrived in Amersfoort at 14:33. I then took a 57m train to Rotterdam Centraal. The DB InterCity train was equiped with a restaurant car, in which I enjoyed a delicious chili.
During one of my days in Rotterdam, I went for a short trip to The Hague. Thankfully, the trip was only 19m, and the fare was included in my Interrail pass.

## F] :belgium: Brussels

Then, came my train to my last *(short)* stay: Brussels. I took the [NS](https://www.ns.nl/) InterCity train 9260 from Rotterdam Centraal to Bruxelles-Central in just 2h.
After Bru[ss|x]elles, I went back home, to Le Mans (France) using a direct [SNCF](https://www.sncf.com/) TGV, in just 3h35m.
