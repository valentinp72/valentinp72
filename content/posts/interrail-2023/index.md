This summer, I did my second Interrail trip. With an [Interrail](https://www.interrail.eu/en) pass, you can travel in many different trains throughout Europe with little to no additional cost. In this post, I will share some pictures I made during this trip through 5 different countries, as well as share the route and trains I have taken. My previous Interrail trip was described in [this post](/posts/interrail-2021).

My journey (5,652 km) started and ended in Le Mans, France. I spent 2 days, 5 hours and 33 minutes in a train, out of 12 days of travel.

## A] :denmark: Copenhagen

My first destination was Copenhagen in Denmark. To get there, I took a TGV (French high speed train) from Le Mans at 9:30 to Strasbourg (France), followed by another TGV to Karlsruhe (Germany) and then an ICE (German high speed train) to Hamburg (Germany). I arrived there at 21:29 with enough time to get a nice lunch before taking the [Snalltaget](https://www.snalltaget.se/en), a night train service that took me to Ørestad (near Copenhagen), Denmark.

Copenhagen is well known for Tivoli Gardens. It is one of the oldest amusement park in the world, and is located inside the city center, just across the street from the main train station. Inside, you will find *Rutschebanen*, the oldest operating roller coaster in Europe (opened in 1914). 

## B] :sweden: Gothenburg

The next day, I took the [Oresundstag](https://www.oresundstag.se/en) train to Gothenburg in Sweden. This train rides on the magnificient Øresund Bridge linking Denmark and Sweden.

Gothenburg is the second largest city in Sweden after Stockholm, with a population of 550k inhabitants. *Stora Delsjön* is a popular lake 7km away from the city center (about 30 minutes by bike).

## C] :sweden: Stockholm

Gothenburg to the capital of Sweden, Stockholm, is really easy and fast with the high speed train from [SJ](https://www.sj.se/en/) (about 3h for 450km). In this train, you can enjoy the views of many different lakes passing by, while eating a delicious meal (if you pre-order it when booking).
