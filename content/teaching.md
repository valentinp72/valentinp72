- In France, the total of hours for teaching activities is computed as (eqTD):
	- Lectures (CM or *Cours Magistraux*): 1.5x
	- Tutorials (TD or *Travaux Dirig√©s*): 1.0x
	- Labs (TP or *Travaux Pratiques*): 1.0x
- In France, *1st*, *2nd* and *3rd* year generally corresponds to the bachelor's degree, while *4th* and *5th* corresponds to the master's degree.
- Teaching activities *in italic* were for non-computer science students (engineering school, chemistry/physics degree, ...)
- Due to University budget cuts, the *Python introduction* tutorials consisted of both standard lectures and tutorials, while being counted as only tutorials.
